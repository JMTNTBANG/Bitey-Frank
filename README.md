# Bitey Frank

The official mascot of the unofficial Discord server of the Garbage Stream.

## Prerequisites

Have the following installed on your system:

1. **[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
2. **[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)**

3. And an IDE of your own choice (**[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** or **[VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** is recommended)



## Required Pip Packages

Once Pip is installed use it to install the following:

1. discord.py - **[(PyPi Page)](https://pypi.org/project/python-discord/)**

2. python-dotenv - **[(PyPi Page)](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)**

2. google-api-python-client - **[(PyPi Page)](https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client/)**



## Configuration

In order to make the bot function, you will need a discord bot TOKEN (If you do not have a discord bot make one **[Here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**)

Next create a `.env` file to the top of the directory, then paste the following inside the file:
```bash
TOKEN=<Your Main Bot Token Here>
DEBUGTOKEN=<Your Debug Bot Token Here>
YTAPIKEY=<Your YouTube Data API Key Here>
```
A font named `fixedsys.ttf` is required in the directory to use the banner clock.

## Development

When working on the bot, add an empty `DEBUG` file to the top directory, to specify that the bot is running in debug mode.

If you would like to create your own server for testing, this template of the Garbage Stream Server is available **[Here](https://discord.new/wBSWQw9dgMfV)**

## Development Optional Extras

You may require some specifc emojis on your server for Frank to function correctly. You can download them **[Here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/NT38Z65P58#gCt56MOhhgq0)** (please note that these are being constantly changed / added to and currently only contain some dice emojis)

For the snarky messages that Frank sends to work you will need a `snarks.csv` file at the top of the Frank directory. The first line of the file will need to include the following:
```bash
Trigger,Response,User
```
Here is an example of a "snark command" that will need to be added into the file:

```bash
<trigger>,<response>,<user>
```

## FAQs

(Any questions asked either on github or on the Garbage Stream discord about the bot will be added here for future reference)
